THERMOSTAT_BLURB =\
<p>\
    Thermostat is a database backed distributed monitoring \
    solution with support for monitoring multiple JVM instances. \
    The system is made up of three (3) components:\
</p>\
<ol>\
    <li>Agents which collect data.</li>\
    <li>Clients, which allow users to visualize collected data.</li>\
    <li>Storage layer which connects the above components.</li>\
</ol>\
<p>\
    The storage layer itself is two-tiered. The endpoint agents \
    and clients communicate with is a web application which uses \
    Mongodb as a backing database. \
</p>\
<p>\
    This setup wizard helps with a setup where all three components \
    run on a local system. In particular, it helps with the setup \
    of the storage layer. First, a user is set up in mongodb which \
    the web endpoint will use for database connections. Second, \
    the web endpoint's servlet config is updated so as to use the \
    credentials of this database user. \
</p>\
<p>\
    Please see the Thermostat User Guide for more information on \
    how to connect clients and agents to the pre-configured storage \
    layer:\
