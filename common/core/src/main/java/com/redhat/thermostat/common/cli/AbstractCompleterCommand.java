/**
 * An abstract class to help with implementing commands which also provide tab completions for arguments within
 * Thermostat shell. This is most useful in cases where an argument and its completions are unique to a single
 * command; if your plugin provides multiple commands which have shared options and shared arguments/completions,
 * more flexibility in the implementation can be had by implementing a {@link CompleterService} directly and separately
 * from the Command implementations.
 *
 * This class is meant for use with OSGi Declarative Services. Subclasses should be annotated with @Component, @Service,
 * and @Property(name = Command.NAME, value = "command-name-here") at minimum.
