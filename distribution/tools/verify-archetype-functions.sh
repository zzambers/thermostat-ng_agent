Something went wrong. You may find the following info useful.

Plug-in root should be: $TMP_DIR/$ARTIFACT_ID
Recompile with:
  $ mvn -Dmaven.repo.local="$M2_REPO" clean package

USER_THERMOSTAT_HOME was:     $USER_THERMOSTAT_HOME
THERMOSTAT_HOME was:          $THERMOSTAT_HOME
Plugin install directory was: $THERMOSTAT_HOME/plugins/$PLUGIN_DIR
