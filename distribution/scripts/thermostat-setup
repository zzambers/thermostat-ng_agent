# Setup utility script in order to assist users in setting up
# mongodb credentials and set web.xml accordingly.
# 
# Upon a new install of thermostat it will not run any command
# until this setup utility has been run. Upon completion this
# script creates a STAMP file in $USER_THERMOSTAT_HOME, namely:
# $USER_THERMOSTAT_HOME/data/setup-complete.stamp
# If the file was created by this utility, it will have content
# similar to:
# "Created by thermostat-setup on YYYY-MM-DD-hh:mm:ss"
# 
# Since this script merely uses thermostat commands for setting
# up the mongodb user, this causes a chicken-and-egg problem.
# We work around this by temporily creating an empty
# setup-complete-file and replacing it by the real file upon
# successful completion.

# For debugging
#set -xv

Thermostat Basics:

Thermostat is a database backed distributed monitoring
solution with support for monitoring multiple JVM instances.
The system is made up of three (3) components:

  1. Agents which collect data.
  2. Clients, which allow users to visualize collected data.
  3. Storage layer which connects the above componets.

The storage layer itself is two-tiered. The endpoint agents
and clients communicate with is a web application which uses
Mongodb as a backing database.

This script helps with a setup where all three components
run on a local system. In particular, it helps with the setup
of the storage layer. First, a user is set up in mongodb which
the web endpoint will use for database connections. Second,
the web endpoint's servlet config is updated so as to use the
credentials of this database user.

Please see the Thermostat User Guide for more information on
how to connect clients and agents to the pre-configured storage
layer:
