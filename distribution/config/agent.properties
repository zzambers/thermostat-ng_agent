# Related to CONFIG_LISTEN_ADDRESS. CONFIG_PUBLISH_ADDRESS will be used
# as an address advertised to clients to reach the agent. If not specified
# defaults to CONFIG_LISTEN_ADDRESS. This config value is useful if the
# listen address of the agent is some local-only resolvable address.
# In that case, specify the globally reachable address of the agent via
# CONFIG_PUBLISH_ADDRESS. See CONFIG_LISTEN_ADDRESS for supported formats.
