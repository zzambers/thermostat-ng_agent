# This file is used if the PropertiesUsernameRolesLoginModule is used
# as a delegate in the JAAS configuration *and* the 'roles.properties' option
# has not been specified for the login module.
#
# If that is the case, this file does two things:
#    1.  It maps user names to roles.
#    2.  Defines an optional recursive set of roles. This is useful in order to
#        define role sets. Users can then be members of such defined role sets.
#        Note that every line which does not have a user name (as defined in the
#        corresponding users.properties file) on the left hand side of the
#        equals sign ('='), represents a role.
#
# A user is assigned multiple roles by separating them by a comma ','. Every
# entity in this file which isn't a user name, will be implicitly defined as a
# role.
