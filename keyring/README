Thermostat Keyring service's JNI library.

- A libsecret based implementation is preferred over
- A libgnome-keyring based implementation

If libsecret is not available a libgnome-keyring based implementation will be
built. If both libgnome-keyring and libsecret are available, the libsecret
based implementation will take precedence. 

Please ensure you have the preferred library's devel packages installed.

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
