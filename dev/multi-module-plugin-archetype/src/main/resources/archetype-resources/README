This is a simple multi-module Thermostat[1] plugin scaffold.

The structure in the file system looks as follows:

└── foo-plugin
    ├── pom.xml (parent pom)
    ├── agent
    ├── storage-common
    ├── client-cli
    └── distribution

The agent directory contains plug-in bits for thermostat agents. This usually
includes some form of back-end.

The client-cli directory contains plug-in bits for thermostat command-line
clients.

The storage-common directory contains model and DAO classes which your plug-in
may contribute. This module is usually a dependency of the agent and client-cli
modules.

The distribution directory is an assembly helper for your plug-in. The most
important part in there is thermostat-plugin.xml. The assembled plug-in can
be found in this module's target directory after a successful maven build.

Enjoy!
