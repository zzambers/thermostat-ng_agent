The jhat tool has been removed from OpenJDK proper (JEP 241[1]). jhat
hprof file parser/validator are needed for parsing heap-dumps in hprof
binary format. The old packages from OpenJDK 9's test library were copied
here (retrieved at revision 5825bc3649dd - top level directory):

jdk.test.lib.hprof.model -> com.redhat.thermostat.vm.heap.analysis.common.hat.hprof.model
jdk.test.lib.hprof.parser -> com.redhat.thermostat.vm.heap.analysis.common.hat.hprof.parser
jdk.test.lib.hprof.util -> com.redhat.thermostat.vm.heap.analysis.common.hat.hprof.util
 
jhat was added in OpenJDK 6 and its original implementation was from 
java.net HAT project [3].
