/**
 * <p>
 * Suite class in order to facilitate running integration tests from CLI. In
 * particular this has been added so as to be able to quickly test downstream
 * packaged thermostat.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After building thermostat from the same sources than packaged thermostat
 * locally via "mvn clean package", this produces the
 * thermostat-integration-tests-standalone-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar in folder
 * integration-tests/standalone/target.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concrete steps are:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   $ wget http://icedtea.wildebeest.org/download/thermostat/thermostat-&lt;VERSION&gt.tar.gz
 *   $ tar -xzf thermostat-&lt;VERSION&gt.tar.gz
 *   $ cd thermostat-&lt;VERSION&gt
 *   $ mvn clean package 
 *   $ java -Dcom.redhat.thermostat.itest.thermostatHome=/path/to/thermostat/install \
 *            -Dcom.redhat.thermostat.itest.thermostatUserHome=$(echo ~/.thermostat) \
 *            -cp $(ls integration-tests/standalone/target/thermostat-integration-tests-standalone-*.jar)
 *            com.redhat.thermostat.itest.standalone.ItestRunner
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This should produce a human readable test report in
 * $(pwd)/thermostat-itest-reports/summary.txt
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you add more test classes, please add those classes to the set of
 * SuiteClasses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that it's only useful to add expectj based tests to
 * the suite. MongoQueriesTest + WebAppTest don't seem to be suitable for
 * downstream packaged thermostat. They would require to be adjusted and/or
 * would need more jars to be on the class path. In particular packaged
 * storage-core, storage-mongodb etc. jars.
 * </p>
