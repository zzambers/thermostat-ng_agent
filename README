Thank you for downloading Thermostat.

REQUIREMENTS:

OpenJDK7
Thermostat requires at least Java 7 to build and run. Thermostat has been tested
with OpenJDK7. Other VMs or versons may or may not work.

Maven (it will download all the java dependencies for you)

MongoDB server
Thermostat requires mongodb (http://www.mongodb.org/) server >= 2.0.0

Either a /etc/os-release file or lsb_release

BUILDING THERMOSTAT:

1. Run "mvn clean package". All tests should pass and the build should succeed.
   Requires a graphical environment for the ui tests.
   
   You can skip the tests phase by running:
   
   mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

   If maven is too chatty, you can try to pass the -q option too:
   
   mvn -q clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
   
2. The resultant Thermostat system can now be found under the directory
   distribution/target.

RUNNING THERMOSTAT:

0. cd into distribution/target directory just created

1. To start the agent and the db:
   bin/thermostat service --start

2. To start the gui client:
   bin/thermostat gui

3. To start the cli client:
   bin/thermostat [--help]
