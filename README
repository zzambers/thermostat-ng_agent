--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. REQUIREMENTS

* OpenJDK7

Thermostat requires at least Java 7 to build and run. Thermostat has been tested
with OpenJDK7. Other VMs or versions may or may not work.

* Maven (it will download all the java dependencies for you)
* Make + GCC
* MongoDB server

Thermostat requires mongodb (http://www.mongodb.org/) server >= 2.0.0

* Either a /etc/os-release file or lsb_release
* Gnome Keyring Daemon development libraries plus pkg-configs
* GTK 2+ development libraries plus pkg-configs

Gnome Keyring/GTK2+ development libraries are required at build time.

You should check your distribution for the exact name of the libraries, on Fedora
based distributions you can obtain it via:

   yum install libgnome-keyring-devel gtk2-devel

on RHEL/Centos 6.x via:

   yum install gnome-keyring-devel gtk2-devel

On Debian (and probably Ubuntu):

   aptitude install libgnome-keyring-dev libgtk2.0-dev

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BUILDING THERMOSTAT

Thermostat consists of "Thermostat Core" and "Thermostat Eclipse". Building
"Thermostat Eclipse" is optional. If you are a first-time Thermostat user, you
might want to try try "Thermostat Core" first.

Thermostat Core consists of:
  * CLI client
  * Swing GUI client
  * The thermostat agent
  * The web service layer (plugged-in optionally)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. BUILDING THERMOSTAT CORE

2.1.1.
   Run "mvn clean install". All tests should pass and the build should
   succeed. It requires a graphical environment for the ui tests.

   Thermostat also includes a Makefile wrapping the maven build.  In most
   cases, simply running "make" will accomplish the same as "mvn clean
   install".  Please see environment variables near beginning of
   Makefile for some options that can be customized.
   
   You can skip the tests phase by running:
   
   mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install

   If maven is too chatty, you can try to pass the "-q" option:
   
   mvn -q -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install
   
2.1.2.
   The resulting Thermostat system can now be found under the directory
   distribution/target/image.
           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. RUNNING THERMOSTAT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. RUNNING THERMOSTAT CORE

  cd into distribution/target/image directory just created

  To start the agent and the db:
  bin/thermostat service

  To start the gui client:
  bin/thermostat gui

  To start the thermostat shell:
  bin/thermostat shell

  Use the help command in order to find out about all available commands:
  bin/thermostat help

See also the user guide in the REFERECES section of this document.


3.1.1. PASSING JVM SPECIFIC OPTIONS TO THERMOSTAT

In some cases, it may be desirable to pass arguments to the virtual machine,
for example to increase memory or change the look and feel for the Swing Client.

Thermostat follows a well established convention to enable this: options that
start with -J are not passed to the thermostat launcher, but instead to the
JVM itself.

For example, this command launches thermostat with the Nimbus Look and Feel,
rather then the default one:

bin/thermostat gui \
    -J-Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.nimbus.NimbusLookAndFeel


3.1.2. GNOME KEYRING AND THERMOSTAT

Thermostat includes support to store user credentials in the Gnome Keyring
daemon, if the user wishes.  If this is not available at runtime, no credentials
will be stored.

4. EXTENDING THERMOSTAT

The README.api file contains a list of public/support API of thermostat.
