  <!--
    This is a stand alone agent for the JVM. It is meant to be loaded
    into target JVMs. It runs outside of thermostat and does not know
    about thermostat. It is not OSGi, and has no dependencies on OSGi
    and does not know about OSGi. It must be compiled with the target
    bytecode format for the oldest supported JVM version.
